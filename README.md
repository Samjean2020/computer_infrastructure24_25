This repository contains my assessment submission for the Computer Infrastructure module. 

For the purpose of the above assessment, I have to demonstrate the following:
1. Use, configure, and script in a command line interface environment,
2. Manipulate and move data and code using the command line,
3. Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures, and
4. Select appropriate infrastructure for a given computational task.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
   
2. Run the code.
